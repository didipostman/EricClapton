the first one is a duo with the defunt Wad√Ø Safi hologramme singing his well known song Layla

Then Eric sing the following 

the Five who followed his path

And the Angel of death must them follow

They followed the leader of that bitter fight 

the must known el Daghbagi   // must = well in old English

and continue with tears in Heaven Lyrics By modifying I by he 

Would you know his name?
If he saw you in heaven
Would it be the same?
If he saw you in heaven
he must be strong
And carry on
'Cause he knows he don't belong
Here in heaven
Would you hold his hand?
If he saw you in heaven
Would you help him stand?
If he saw you in heaven
he'll find his way
Through night and day
'Cause he knows he just can't stay
Here in heaven
Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please
Begging please
Beyond the door
There's peace, I'm sure
And he knows there'll be no more
Tears in heaven
Would you know his name?
If he saw you in heaven
Would you be the same?
If he saw you in heaven
He must be strong
And carry on
'Cause he know he don't belong
Here in heaven
